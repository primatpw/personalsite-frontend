# Personal Website

A simple website developed as an assignment for RISTEK 2019 Web Development junior member application.

Built using:

- React (Bootstrapped using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))
- React Router
- Styled Components

- Express
- Mongoose
- MongoDB Atlas

Frontend repo: [GitHub](https://github.com/davenathanael/ristek-personalsite-frontend)
Backend repo: [GitHub](https://github.com/davenathanael/ristek-personalsite-backend)

## How to run

- Clone both repositories
- For frontend, run `yarn && yarn start`
- For backend, run `yarn && yarn start`

Note: the frontend app will still fetch data from my hosted Heroku API. You would want to change some urls (API url at frontend, MongoDB url string at backend)
